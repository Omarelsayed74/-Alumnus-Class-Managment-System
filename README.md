 In the realm of education, the process of teaching and learning can often be complex
 and challenging. To alleviate some of these difficulties, we have developed a
 comprehensive database project aimed at simplifying the teaching process. This
 report outlines the design, implementation, and functionality of the project, which
 utilizes a PostgreSQL database, a Java GUI application, and an API.
 The primary purpose of this project is to provide educators with a user-friendly
 platform that streamlines various teaching activities and facilitates effective
 communication between teachers and students. By leveraging the capabilities of the
 database, users can create virtual classrooms, share important announcements,
 conduct sessions, administer quizzes, and manage attendance seamlessly.
 The database design incorporates key entities such as users, rooms, sessions, news
 (announcements), quizzes, questions, attendance records, and messaging
 functionality. Through the Java GUI application, teachers can effortlessly create
 rooms and invite students to join using unique room IDs. Room owners have
 additional privileges, including the ability to create announcements (News), schedule
 sessions, create quizzes, and assign administrators to assist with room management.
 For students, the platform offers a range of features, including the ability to attend
 sessions, access and review announcements, and participate in quizzes. The project
 aims to enhance the learning experience by providing a centralized and organized
 platform that supports effective communication, engagement, and assessment within
 the educational setting.
 By implementing the project in two different methods, a Java GUI application and an
 API, we ensure accessibility and flexibility for users. The Java GUI application serves
 as a user-friendly interface, enabling educators and students to interact with the
 database effortlessly. Additionally, the API facilitates seamless integration with other
 systems and provides opportunities for further expansion and customization.
 Overall, this database project intends to simplify the teaching process, foster
 effective collaboration, and improve engagement between teachers and students. By
 leveraging the power of a well-designed database, the project aims to create a
 dynamic educational environment that optimizes teaching and learning experiences.
